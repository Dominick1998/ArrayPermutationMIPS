# Array Permutation (MIPS Assembly)

## Overview
This project contains a MIPS assembly program that permutes an integer array using loops with indirect or indexed addressing. The program prompts the user to input an array and a permutation, and then rearranges the array based on the provided permutation.

## Project Details
**Course**: Assembly Language  
**Assignment**: 3  
**Date**: October 9, 2023  
**Author**: Dominick Ferro  

## Description
- **Input Array**: The program prompts the user to input 10 elements of an array.
- **Input Permutation**: The program then prompts the user to input a permutation of the array.
- **Permutation Algorithm**: The program rearranges the array elements based on the provided permutation using indirect or indexed addressing.
- **Output**: The rearranged array is displayed as the output.

## Files
- `src/array_permutation.asm`: MIPS assembly source code for the array permutation program.

## How to Run
1. **Assemble and run the code** using a MIPS simulator such as MARS or SPIM:
   - Open `array_permutation.asm` in the MIPS simulator.
   - Assemble the program.
   - Run the program and follow the prompts to input the array elements and the permutation.
